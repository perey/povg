    '''Represents an EGL context configured for OpenVG.

    Instance attributes:
    display, config, ctxhandle, render_buffer -- Inherited from
        pegl.context.Context.
    api -- Inherited from pegl.context.Context. Should always be the
        string 'OpenVG'.
    api_version -- Inherited from pegl.context.Context, but never
        relevant.

    Access to OpenVG-specific context parameters is possible through
    attributes inherited from Context. Note that these parameters apply
    to the current OpenVG context, which is not necessarily the Context
    instance being used to query them. You should ensure that your
    context instance is current (using make_current()) before querying
    or setting any of these parameters.

            available OpenVG-supporting configuration will be used.
