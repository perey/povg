Povg: Python 3 binding for OpenVG
=================================

Povg is a binding to OpenVG_ 1.1, written in native Python 3 through
the ctypes_ library. It provides comprehensive access to OpenVG_
functions, while offering a very Pythonic API.

OpenVG_ is a specification from the Khronos Group that provides a
low-level vector graphics API, which can be hardware-accelerated on
supporting hardware.
